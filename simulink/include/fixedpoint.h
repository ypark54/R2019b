/* Abstract:
 *
 * The primary motivation of this header file is to allow customers to
 * write C language S-functions that support fixed-point data types.  However,
 * the API in this header extends beyond fixed-point and includes support for
 * standard floating point and integer data types.  
 *
 * This header contains definitions and prototypes for use in creating 
 * Simulink S-functions that can process a wide variety of data types.
 * These data types include the Simulink builtin data types,
 *     double        single
 *     uint8         int8
 *     uint16        int16
 *     uint32        int32
 * all the MathWorks defined fixed-point data types such as
 *     sfix16_En15
 *     ufix32_En16
 *     ufix128
 *     sfix37_S3_B5
 * and the versions of data types obtained when Data Type Override is set
 * to Scaled Doubles such as
 *     flts16
 *     flts16_En15
 *     fltu32_S3_B5
 *
 * This header file contains functions and definitions that allow S-functions
 * to determine which of these data types an input port or output port is
 * using.  The S-function can also specify which of these data types should
 * be used for an input, output, DWork state, or Runtime Parameter.  The
 * information required to properly read to and write from different variables
 * of each data type is given.
 */

/* Note on License Design:
 *
 * The following comments are simply an attempt to clarify the License Design 
 * so that authors can write better S-functions.
 * As of 
 *      Release 13
 *      Simulink 5.0
 *      Fixed-Point Blockset 4.0
 * all the blocks from Fixed-Point Blockset were merged into Simulink.  All
 * the blocks are installed even if a user does not have a Fixed-Point License.
 * Simulink customers can use all the blocks with any builtin data types that a
 * block supports.  If all the blocks in a model are only using builtin data
 * types and the Min-Max-Overflow Logging Mode is set to Force Off, then a 
 * Fixed-Point License is NOT required.  If any block in a model is "actively" 
 * using a non-builtin fixed-point data type or is actively logging Min-Max and/or
 * Overflow information, then a Fixed-Point License will be required for the 
 * remainder of that Matlab session.  
 *   Even if blocks in a model are configured to have fixed-point signals and/or
 * configured to log Min-Max-Overflow information, then simply loading, viewing, 
 * editing, or saving a model should not trigger active use.  Actions such as 
 * Update Diagram, Simulation, and Code Generation from such a model are active 
 * use and would cause a Fixed-Point License to be checked out.
 *   S-functions written using the API in this header file should be able to
 * follow this license design.  For example, suppose an S-function is written
 * so that it can handle any builtin or fixed-point data type.  Suppose in a
 * particular model, this S-function is processing just builtin data types such 
 * as double, single, uint8, or int32.  That use case would not trigger a 
 * Fixed-Point License to be checked out.  Suppose in a different model,
 * the S-function was processing non-builtin fixed-point data types.  That use,
 * like any other use of fixed-point data types, would cause a Fixed-Point 
 * License to be checked out.
 *   The key pitfall S-function authors must guard against is registering
 * a fixed-point data type when a model is simply being loaded or viewed.  In
 * Simulink jargon, loading or opening a model or sub-system is a 
 * "Sizes Call Only."  The Simulink S-function API provides a way to detect a
 * "Sizes Call Only", so by careful programming, an S-function author can avoid 
 * Fixed-Point License problems when a user is simply loading or viewing a model.
 */

/* Simulink supports fixed-point data types with any number of bits from
 *    1 to FXP_MAX_BITS for unsigned numbers and 
 *    2 to FXP_MAX_BITS for signed numbers.
 * The API in this header file treats pure integers just like
 * any other fixed-point numbers.  Pure integers just happen 
 * to have trivial scaling.  The 6 standard Simulink integer
 * types uint8, int8, uint16, int16, uint32, and int32 are not 
 * exceptions.  They are treated like fixed-point numbers 
 * that happened to have trivial scaling and happened to have
 * 8, 16, or 32 bits.  The same API applies.
 *   Simulink builtin integers are special only in that they do
 * not trigger the need for a Fixed-Point License. 
 *
 * The number of bits used to represent a signal in simulation
 * may be more than the number specified.  In this case, the
 * signals will be emulated inside various sized containers 
 * according to the following rules.  For 32 or fewer bits, the
 * rules are simple.  For 32 or fewer bits, the container is a
 * scalar integer type directly understood by the compiler.  The
 * case of using a scalar integer type is classified as single-word.
 * The three cases with 32 or fewer bits are shown by a table.
 *
 *   Specified Bits       Container Bits   Container typedef
 *    1 to  8              8               int8_T  or uint8_T
 *    9 to 16             16               int16_T or uint16_T
 *   17 to 32             32               int32_T or uint32_T
 *
 * For 33 or more bits, the rules are more complicated and can
 * depend on the model, the Matlab Host, the current target
 * for code generation, and the version of Simulink Fixed Point
 * being used.  Signals with 33 or more bits will either be stored 
 * using a single-word 
 * container with more than 32 bits or will be stored using a 
 * multi-word representation.
 *
 * All multi-word representations will follow a general form.
 * 
 * typedef struct {
 *     SOME_UNSIGNED_CHUNK_TYPE chunks[ NUM_CHUNKS_FOR_M_BITS ];
 * } (u)intM_T
 *
 * The chunk at index zero will hold the least significant bits, and
 * the highest index will hold the most significant bits.
 *
 * Whether single-word or multi-word is used can depend on 
 * the model, the Matlab Host, the current 
 * target for code generation, and the version of Simulink Fixed Point.
 * The specific type used for SOME_UNSIGNED_CHUNK_TYPE can also vary depending
 * on the model, the Matlab Host, the current target for code generation,
 * and the version of Simulink Fixed Point.
 * 
 * To be portable, sfunctions that are intended to support fixed-point
 * signals with more than 32 bits must react to container variations
 * at runtime.  The most general way to do this is to use the interfaces
 * for getting and setting "bit-regions" provided by this header.
 * To support use of code optimized to a specific additional APIs
 * are provided that can query the current properties of a data type.
 * However, sfunction authors need to be aware the properties of a data 
 * type can vary depending on
 * the model, the Matlab Host, the current 
 * target for code generation, and the version of Simulink Fixed Point.
 * A robustly written sfunction will need to check the properties at runtime
 * at least once after update diagram has started.  The most portable sfunctions
 * will be written so that they can use an optimized case if possible or 
 * switch to general bit-region case if necessary.  At the very least,
 * a robust sfunction will need to gracefully set an error if does not
 * have a case that supports the current memory layout.  Keep in mind that
 * supporting every specific case for the current release of Simulink Fixed Point
 * does not guarantee that every specific case in a future release will be 
 * covered.  For this reason, it is best to have bit-region case or at
 * the very least gracefully error if needed.
 *
 * For signed numbers, the bit encoding format is always 
 * two's complement.
 *
 * When the specified number of bits is less than the size of
 * the container, the desired bits are always stored in the
 * least significant part of the container.  Any "unused" bits
 * are in the most significant part of the container.  
 * 
 * For both single word case and multiword cases, any unused bits 
 * must be set to a sign extension.  If the data type is
 * an unsigned number, then obviously, the number is always
 * nonnegative so the (implicit) sign bit is zero.  For unsigned
 * data types, all unused bits must always be cleared to zero.
 *    If the data type is a signed number, then the sign bit is
 * one for strictly negative numbers and zero otherwise.  If
 * the stored integer is negative, then all unused bits must be
 * set to one.  If the stored integer is positive, then all
 * unused bits must be cleared to zero.
 *
 * Simulink also supports two builtin floating point data types.  
 * These are the standard floating point singles and doubles.
 *
 * Simulink also supports a data type category that is a hybrid 
 * between floating-point and fixed-point.  This category is
 * called ScaledDouble.  ScaledDouble cases occur when
 * an individual block is configured to have a fixed-point
 * output, but the system it lives in has its Data Type Override 
 * setting for a system is set to Scaled Doubles.  The
 * resulting data type has the scaling the fixed-point
 * specification, but stores its output using floating 
 * point doubles.  Storing in a double means that overflow
 * and precision issues are almost always eliminated. Removing the 
 * range and precision issues is very useful for benchmarking, testing, 
 * and debugging. 
 *   ScaledDouble data types contain information
 * signedness and number of bits of what their non-overrided data 
 * types would have been.  This is useful for information for other
 * portions of the model that are not being debugged with Data Type 
 * Override.

/* Simulink Scaling
 *
 * Simulink data types support scaling.  The Fixed-Point User's Guide
 * presents the following general formula.
 * 
 *    V = S * Q + B
 *
 * where
 *
 *    V is the Real World Value in the engineering units of choice
 *    Q is the called the Stored Integer Value.  It is the raw value 
 *      stored in the digital hardware.  Despite the name Q can use
 *      an integer or a floating point format.
 *    S is the Slope.  For clarity, this is also called the Total-Slope
 *    B is the Bias
 *
 * The Total-Slope is often decomposed into two parts.
 *
 *    S = F * 2^E
 *
 * where
 *
 *   1. <= F < 2.0
 *
 *    F is the Fractional Slope
 *    E is the Fixed Exponent, E is always an integer.
 *
 * If
 *    B == 0.0
 * and
 *    F == 1.0
 * then
 * there is a clean binary point interpretation.
 *
 *    Fraction Length = -1 * Fixed Exponent 
 *
 * For example, if 
 *    S == 0.125
 *    B == 0.0
 * then
 *    F == 1.0
 *    E == -3
 * so
 *    Fraction Length = 3
 * therefore, this data type has 3 bits to the right of the
 * binary point.
 *
 * The concept of scaling is most useful for fixed-point cases, but
 * it does generalize to all the scalar numeric data types.  For
 * floating point doubles and singles and for pure integers, 
 * the scaling is trivial
 *    B == 0
 *    S == 1
 *    F == 1
 *    E == 0
 *    Fraction Length == 0
 * The access methods to get scaling information can be used
 * for all the data types, they just return trivial values
 * when the scaling is trivial.
